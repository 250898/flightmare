Documentation Standard
======================

This document will serve as a guide and an example of some rules that need to be followed in order to contribute to the documentation.

Docs Structure
--------------

We use `Sphinx <https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/intro/getting-started-with-sphinx.html>`_ with ReStructuredText.

This will re-generate the respective rst files inside ``FLIGHTMARE_PATH/docs/source`` by using ``make html`` in ``FLIGHTMARE_PATH/docs/``.

Rules
-----

*   Leave always an empty line between sections and at the end of the document.

*   Add a break after each sentence.
